# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## 🎯 Objective
Explore the Iris dataset to understand data trends and relationships between different features using basic statistics and visualizations.

## 📁 Dataset Used
- **Iris Dataset** — A classic dataset included with seaborn. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 measurements:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
  - Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using seaborn.
2. Displayed shape, column names, and previewed the first few rows.
3. Used `.info()` and `.describe()` for summary statistics.
4. Created visualizations:
   - Pairplot (scatter plot matrix)
   - Histograms for distribution
   - Boxplots for outlier detection

## 📊 Results & Insights
- The dataset is clean (no missing values).
- Petal length and width are useful in classifying flower species.
- Clear visual separability between species using petal features.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all code cells one by one to view outputs and plots.

## 📌 File Included
- `Task_1_Iris_Exploration.ipynb`: Complete code with comments and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining what the task is about.
